# Farm-to-Fork
Farm to fork traceability 


By storing every Farmer information in form of ID from every lot of crop, then generation that lot ID, storing it in the form of QR code 
and attaching this QR code on every final product made from that lot may help to trace the origin of the food.
We will provide an app for user to register and login, after login user can store information about the farmer from whom he buy crops, 
from this info unique ID of that farmer is generated, as lot containing crops from different farmers, an unique ID will be generated from
farmers ID whose crop is present in the lot.
This ID will then be pass with the lot to industry, then a QR code will be generated from lot ID which will then be printed on food
